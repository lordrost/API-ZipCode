# Distance Between Zip Codes (EN)


 * Currently Supported and tested within United States ZIP codes

This script allows you to quickly and easily figure out the distance between zip codes.

How that works:
 - Enter First and Second ZipCode. 
 - Script will return the distance between entered zip codes or error if Zip code not found.
 

* I'm using API from http://www.zipcodeapi.com
